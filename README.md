# pathfinding-visualizer
Pathfinding visualizer built using the Pygame module from Python. The user must set a start and end node and also has the option of placing walls/obstacles that the algorithm must circumnavigate. The program features 5 distinct pathfinding algorithms (a-star, dijkstra's, greedy best first search, breadth first search, and depth first search) for the user to select.
